# Portfolio-website\_\_challenge2

This is a website that will display my portfolio, made for challenge 2 of my bootcamp. Future repositories may have more up-to-date portfolios as part of the coding exercises

# Notes for the viewer of this website:

- my avatar is intentionally like that. I wanted it to be a little silly for the viewer of the website. Please enjoy the change in the avatar as the viewing window is narrowed
- This is my first foray into CSS. It was very challenging at times, but I do think that I've come out of the other side of it with a better overall understanding of it
- I do not have enough projects yet, so I made some placeholders that simply linked to my main github page. I hope that that is satisfactory
- There is an empty js file in the repository. I figured that I will probably be building upon this website in the future, so I wanted to include that there for quick access
