# Portfolio-website\_\_challenge2

This is a website that will display my portfolio, made for challenge 2 of my bootcamp. Future repositories may have more up-to-date portfolios as part of the coding exercises

# Notes for the viewer of this website:

- my avatar is intentionally like that. I wanted it to be a little silly for the viewer of the website. Please enjoy the change in the avatar as the viewing window is narrowed
- This is my first foray into CSS. It was very challenging at times, but I do think that I've come out of the other side of it with a better overall understanding of it
- I do not have enough projects yet, so I made some placeholders that simply linked to my main github page. I hope that that is satisfactory
- There is an empty js file in the repository. I figured that I will probably be building upon this website in the future, so I wanted to include that there for quick access
- All images (except for my beautiful face) were sourced from https://unsplash.com/
- my code is a little sparse on comments. When it comes to HTML and CSS, I have trouble deciding what is relevant to the viewer of the code. After all, it seems almost self-explanatory at times. I have an easier time commenting when I've written code that actually transforms and performs operations, as it is necessary to let the code viewer know what they are looking at to make squashing any future bugs easier. I'm sure we'll learn good comment etiquette going forward

## I hope you enjoy my website! It was a bit daunting to make, but also enjoyable!
